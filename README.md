# Do-smaller-class-sizes-result-in-better-grades
This is an exercise to understand if smaller class sizes result in better grades using Regression Discontinuity Design

This was inspired by a paper: 'USING MAIMONIDESâ€™ RULE TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF CLASS SIZE ON SCHOLASTIC ACHIEVEMENT BY JOSHUA D. ANGRIST AND VICTOR LAVY

There are several factors apart from class size for which means and SD were provided: avg score in maths, enrollment, % Disadvantaged, Reading size, math size and avg score in verbal

I used randomly generated normal distribution with the given means and SD for the missing data on the above mentioned variables

Next, I ran Regression Discontinuity Design to find out which variables affect grades
